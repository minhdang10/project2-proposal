## What is your application?
1. Problem: 
* The need for biking to slowly enjoy the cities are increasing 
* Bikes station are scattered everywhere, and tourists need to know the closest one to be there as soon as possible
2. Solution:
* Show the nearest city bike station when the user inputs the address/zip code/ coordinates and also return the station information

## What 3rd party API are you going to use?
* https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes
* http://api.citybik.es/v2/? fbclid=IwAR2TpUUAClRbMLAOWrN-AZFrA6fruZ7onCNNOOZdvBMFhK4APzWmvc2X18Y
* http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks

## Tentative Technology:
Calculate distance based on the coordinates
Return the closest available bikes and docks
Having multiple filters (name, system, company, etc.)
